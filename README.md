# Teensy_Harmonica
A project to make a MIDI "harmonica" wind controller on the Teensy 3.1!

This project is in the way way way beginning stage. The basic code architecture comes from the ["Gordophone" DIY wind controller project](http://gordophone.blogspot.com/), with some other ideas from the ["MIDI Xylophone" project](https://github.com/jdeboi/xylophone). Stay tuned for more!
